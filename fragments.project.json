It's possible for someone's life experience to be wholly different from their physical experience, and they have no way to know.  This is also a bit more expanded concept (I hope it's addressed elsewhere too): if you worked in a holodeck office, but everyone was in their own little holodeck, then perhaps, none of your interactions with other people would have to be te interactions you thought they were.  If you doing X is someone else seeing Y, then at its farthest logical limit, nothing you do equates to what you might predict other people see you doing.  Maybe you live in a sci-fi cyber punk world, but everyone around you is playing a different game.  When this happens, if interactions between people are mediated (translated) by a computer, why even let the humans interact at all?  Why not just have the computer act as a generalized buffer between all humans in all interactions?\n\nsee also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain\n",
