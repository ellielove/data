It's possible for someone's life experience to be wholly different from their physical experience, and they have no way to know.  This is also a bit more expanded concept (I hope it's addressed elsewhere too): if you worked in a holodeck office, but everyone was in their own little holodeck, then perhaps, none of your interactions with other people would have to be te interactions you thought they were.  If you doing X is someone else seeing Y, then at its farthest logical limit, nothing you do equates to what you might predict other people see you doing.  Maybe you live in a sci-fi cyber punk world, but everyone around you is playing a different game.  When this happens, if interactions between people are mediated (translated) by a computer, why even let the humans interact at all?  Why not just have the computer act as a generalized buffer between all humans in all interactions?\n\nsee also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain\n",

A self-sustaining recursion, is most easily seen in the life and movement of a photon--an electrical field, which produces a magnetic field on a perpendicular axis, and dies, and then the magnetic field produces an electrical field on a perpendicular axis, and it dies.\n\nThis recursion sustains all of creation, in a ritualistic ebb and flow, and ensures that every creature, no matter how impressive, has a god standing over it in immesurable power, and a worm standing beneath it, in immeasurable weakness.  Every creature exists in all three of these positions at once, forming a system which connects every creature, every moment of time, every volume of space, every piece of matter, and every pattern laid upon them.\n\nThe speaker, recognizes this---the true nature of every existence (turtles, all the way down; as it were)--and despite the overwhelming, incomprehensible, immeasurable weight of it all, still retains their sense of self-worth, self-love, and a desire to be equal in legitimacy to all others.  (Neither above nor below, but a kindred)\n\nTo do this, a person must consider themselves before the physical forces of their world, know that they will one day be torn assunder, and still delight--both in themselves, and in the forces which will cause their inevitable doom\n\n",
