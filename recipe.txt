I have a fear that's always held me back.  I was afraid to come and speak to this group about it,
because I was afraid of some particular facet of this fear.

So I thought deeply about this fact, and I thought deeply about this fear.

"And I realized" this fact: <fact>.  (And I performed a mental evaluation of my preferred mental states,
realizing that a certain application of perspectives to the data, allowed me to see the act of coming here
as a preferable mental state)
